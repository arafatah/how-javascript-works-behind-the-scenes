/* # This

- **Global Context**: `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
- **Function (Non-strict Mode)**: `this` refers to the global object, unless explicitly called with a different context.
- **Strict Mode**: `this` is `undefined` in functions unless bound to an object.
- **Object Method**: `this` refers to the object that the method belongs to / means owner of the object.
- **Constructor/Class**: `this` refers to the new instance created by the constructor or class.
- **Arrow Functions**: `this` is lexically bound, meaning it refers to `this` from the outer function or context where it is defined. Like if itâ€™s define in global, then it will refer window.
- **Event Handlers**: `this` refers to the element that triggered the event.
- **`call()`, `apply()`, `bind()`**: These methods allow you to explicitly set the value of `this` for a function. */
